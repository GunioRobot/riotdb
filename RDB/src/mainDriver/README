Project: R with I/O Transparency (RIOT) Library
Author:  Herodotos Herodotou

Description: This library allows the RIOT prototype package to interface
             with the msql database.

General Files:

- config.h
	Contains the database location and credentials.

- testVector.c
	Contains regression tests for the vector functions.

- testMatrix.c
	Contains regression tests for the matrix functions.

- testDelete.c
	Deletes all tables from the database

- Makefile
	Contains commands for compiling the source code and running tests
	Commands: 
		"make regression" - performs all regression tests
		"make reset" - deletes all tables and resets the database
		"make clean" - deletes all unnecessary files

Library files:

- rdb_aggregate_functions.c/h
	Contains aggregate functions for vectors (sum, avg, max, min).

- rdb_basics.c/h
	Contains necessary constants, the RDBVector definition, the RDBMatrix
	definition and functions for initializing, copying, clearing and loading
	RDBVectors and RDBMatrices.

- rdb_binary_operators.c/h
	Contains functions for binary operators for vectors (+, -, *, /, %).

- rdb_compare_vectors.c/h
	Contains functions for vector comparisons with other vectors or values.

- rdb_convert_vectors.c/h
	CContains functions for performing data type conversions for vectors.

- rdb_delete_vector_data.c/h
	Contains functions for deleting elements from vectors (delete all, 
	single values, range of values or sparse values).

- rdb_element_functions.c/h
	Contains element-wise functions for vectors (sin, cos, pow, sqrt).

- rdb_get_matrix_data.c/h
	Contains functions for accessing elements in vectors (get all, single 
	values).

- rdb_get_vector_data.c/h
	Contains functions for accessing elements in vectors (get all, single 
	values, range of values, sparse values, with other dbvectors as indexes 
	or with logic dbvectors).

- rdb_handle_matrix_tables.c/h
	Contains functions for managing matrix tables (create, delete, dublicate,
	check for N/A).

- rdb_handle_matrix_views.c/h
	Contains functions for handling matrix views (i.e create, drop, 
	materialize views and keep track of view references)

- rdb_handle_metadata.c/h
	Contains functions for managing the matadata table.

- rdb_handle_vector_tables.c/h
	Contains functions for managing vector tables (create, delete, dublicate,
	check for N/A).

- rdb_handle_vector_views.c/h
	Contains functions for handling vector views (i.e create, drop, 
	materialize views and keep track of view references)

- rdb_insert_matrix_data.c/h
	Contains functions for inserting data to an EMPTY matrix either explicitely 
	or load from a file

- rdb_insert_vector_data.c/h
	Contains functions for inserting data to a vector either explicitely 
	or load from a file

- rdb_matrix_function.c/h
	Contains functions for matrices (multiplication)

- rdb_set_vector_data.c/h
	Contains functions for updating elements in an existing vector (setting a 
	single value, range of values, sparce values, with dbvectors containing
 	indexes and logic vectors).

- rdb_sort_vector.c/h

In order to present a consistent interface to most programs written in
R, RIOT overrides a set of operators defined in the R language. By
doing so RIOT provides its own implementation that is I/O-efficient
for common operations in R. In this document, we describe some of the
important operators identified in the process of designing RIOT. Most
of the implementations of these listed operators can be found in the
RIOTDB/R/riotdb.R file. Also note that this is not intended to be a
complete list, but could be expanded and amended in the future.

A. Data Creation Operators.

The following operators are used to create vectors/arrays. In RIOT,
these operators are overridden to return dbvector or dbarray types
when the result would be too large.

`:`:  regular sequence generator, e.g., 1:n gives a sequence 1,2,...,n
seq:  a richer version of `:`
read.table, etc: for loading external data files
load.dbvector, load.dbmatrix etc: for loading external database tables (not found in R)

B. Generic Group Methods.

Certain types of operators can be overridden for new data types. R
groups these operators into three categories:
Math     : abs, acos, log, ...
Summary  : max, min, ...
Ops      : +,-,*,/, ...

The full list can be found in Section 5.6 in [1]. There are some other
operators missing in these groups, such as 'sqrt'. For more
information, consult the help topics on 'Arithmetic', 'sqrt',
'Special', etc in R, or check the output of the getGenerics() function
in R.

C. Access Operators.

Elements of vectors, matrices, arrays etc are accessed by the `[`
operator, and modified by the subset assignment operator `[<-`.

D. Special Numerical Operators for Matrices.

This category includes:
%*%   : matrix multiplication
solve : solves the equation a %*% x = b for x
chol,qr,... : matrix factorization methods

E. Attribute Operators.

length  : gets the length of a vector
dim     : gets the dimension of a matrix/array
dim<-   : sets the dimension of a matrix/array

F. Misc Operators.

print   : prints the object
show	: displays the object

RIOTDB: transparently bringing scalability and I/O-efficiency to
statistical computing with R

NOTE: This is only a prototype implementation for demonstrating
research ideas.

--------------------------

To install RIOTDB on a Unix-like system, follow these instructions:

1) Extract the downloaded package and cd to the top level directory of
   the package (where this file resides). Paths in the following are
   relative to this directory.

2) Setting up a databse. Currently RIOTDB uses MySQL as its
   backend. Please make sure you have access to a MySQL server. You
   can modify the server address, username, and password in the
   RIOTDB/src/clib/config.h file to match your settings. The default
   username RIOTDB assumes is 'mysql' and the default password is
   empty.

3) Make sure your mysql user has the following privileges: CREATE,
   CREATE VIEW, DELETE, DROP, FILE, INDEX, SELECT, SUPER, TRIGGER,
   UPDATE. A simpler way to do this is:

   $ mysql -u root # log in as root
   # replace 'mysql' and 'localhost' with the real server host and user name
   $ grant all privileges on *.* to 'mysql'@'localhost'
   $ grant super on *.* to 'mysql'@'localhost'

4) Next use the script RIOTDB/src/scripts/init_riotdb.sql to
   initialize and populate the database:

   $ mysql -u mysql
   $ \. <path_to_the_script>

   If any error should occur, go back to Step 3 and make sure the user
   has enough privileges.

5) Check the RIOTDB/src/Makefile file to make sure the directories for
   MySQL include and library files match with your settings.

6) Compile the package with

   $ R CMD INSTALL ROITDB

   The RIOTDB package will be installed. If you want to have it
   installed in a customized directory, make a file $HOME$/.Renviron
   with the following contents before installing the package:

   R_LIBS=<path>

7) (Optional) Patch R. If you want to use an optimized version of
   RIOTDB (see the discussion at
   http://www.cs.duke.edu/dbgroup/Main/RIOT-interface), use the file
   R-RIOTDB.patch to patch the official R source and rebuild R. Any
   reasonably modern R release should work.

   $ cd <top level of R's source tree>
   $ patch -p1 < <path to the R-RIOTDB.patch file>
   $ ./configure # build R as usual
   $ make && make install

8) Use RIOTDB. Start R and use the following statement to load RIOTDB:

   > library(RIOTDB)
